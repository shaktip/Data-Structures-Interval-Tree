Function :
1. Creating Centered BST for BuildT: 
        This is binary tree is created on the concept of complete binary tree.
        where left tree always contains greater than or equal to the number of
        nodes in the right.
        Time Complexity O(nlogn)
2. Creating File input.dot :
        It is created on the inorder traversal of BST concept.
        Time Complexity : O(nlogn)
        
3. Insert a new Interval :
        According to given span the new interval is added to BST, 
        Time Complexity : In Best Case it is O(logn)
                          In Worst Case it is O(n)
                          
4. FindOverlaps :
        To Create a Overlap from Tree takes O(logn+k)
        where k is how many composers can overlap, so it is output sensitive
        complexity.
        
        
5. MaxOverlaps :
        From Given Interval, the overlapping interval finding takes O(k) time, where
        k is size output,
        but since every interval cannot be MaxOverlap, Max overlap is more than
        50% overlap of an interval in the given span, which takes constant time to
        find
        so Overall Complexity is O(logn + k)
        
6. FindSongs :
        From Given interval, to find the overlapping interval and printing their
        songs genrewise takes O(logn + k + m)
        where n is no of composers
        k is size of overlaps
        m is max size of genre

7. BuildIG : 
        It is to build a graph from the overlapping intervals.
        It requires to read all the composer, and find the overlaps with them
        and then build the nodes and edges for the graph.
        so time complexity is 
        O(n * (logn + k))
        where n is no of composer
        k is maximum size of overlap
           

8. BiggestTeam :
         Since it uses MaxClique implementation, so it requires
         O(n^2 * 2^n)
         
9. FindGroup :
         It requires to find Biggest and Smallest Group Sizes which may 
         overlap with at least one in the group.
         so it needs DFS traversal.
         Time Complexity is O(v + E)
